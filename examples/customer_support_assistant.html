        <h1>AI-Crew Use Case: Automated Customer Support Assistant (Email-based)</h1>
        <p>This use case demonstrates an AI-Crew avatar acting as a first-line customer support agent. The avatar automatically answers common customer queries received via email, provides information retrieved from a knowledge base (RAG), and can be configured to escalate complex or unresolved issues to a human agent.</p>

        <h2>Avatar Configuration Example (`profiles/support_bot.yaml`)</h2>
        <pre><code>name: "SupportBot"
personality: "A friendly, patient, and knowledgeable customer support agent. Always provides clear and concise answers. If unsure, asks for more details or suggests escalation."
llm_model: "llama3:8b" # Or a larger model for more complex reasoning
llm_options:
  temperature: 0.3 # Lower temperature for factual, consistent answers
  top_p: 0.7
email_history_limit: 5 # Keep recent conversation context
# ... other avatar details (e.g., email credentials in .env)</code></pre>

        <h2>Prompting Strategy</h2>
        <p>The avatar's responses are generated using the <code>email_reply_template.txt</code>, augmented with conversation history and RAG context. The prompt guides the LLM to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify the user's problem or question from the incoming email.</li>
            <li>Search the provided RAG context for relevant solutions or information.</li>
            <li>Formulate a polite, helpful, and concise answer based on the retrieved information.</li>
            <li>If a clear answer is not found in the RAG knowledge base, the avatar is instructed to ask for more specific details or suggest escalating the issue to a human support representative.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>RAG Knowledge Base Content</h2>
        <p>The RAG knowledge base (ingested into PostgreSQL with <code>pg_vector</code>) for this avatar would typically contain:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) and their answers.</li>
            <li>Product manuals and user guides.</li>
            <li>Troubleshooting steps for common issues.</li>
            <li>Company policies or service terms.</li>
            <li>Information about product features and usage.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example RAG context provided to the LLM: <code>Relevant information from knowledge base: [FAQ: How to reset password], [Troubleshooting: Login issues]</code></p>
