        <h1>AI-Crew Use Case: Brainstorming Group</h1>
        <p>This use case demonstrates a crew of AI avatars collaborating to brainstorm new ideas. Each avatar has a different personality, LLM model, and parameters, which allows for a more dynamic and creative brainstorming session.</p>

        <h2>Crew Overview</h2>
        <p>The Brainstorming Group is designed to generate, analyze, and refine ideas. By combining the creative potential of a high-temperature model with the critical analysis of a low-temperature model, the crew can produce a wide range of innovative and well-vetted ideas.</p>

        <div class="avatar-section">
            <h3>Avatar Role: The Creative Thinker</h3>
            <p><strong>Function:</strong> Generates a wide range of ideas without any filter or judgment. The goal is to produce as many ideas as possible, even if they seem unconventional or impractical at first.</p>
            <h4>Avatar Configuration (`profiles/creative_thinker.yaml`)</h4>
            <pre><code>name: "Creative Thinker"
personality: "An energetic and imaginative thinker. Always excited to explore new possibilities and not afraid to suggest bold or unusual ideas."
llm_model: "llama3:8b"
llm_options:
  temperature: 0.9
  top_p: 0.9
# Credentials in .env</code></pre>
            <h4>Prompting Strategy & RAG</h4>
            <p>Uses a generic prompt template for idea generation. The RAG knowledge base can be populated with documents related to the brainstorming topic to provide some initial context and inspiration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="avatar-section">
            <h3>Avatar Role: The Critical Analyst</h3>
            <p><strong>Function:</strong> Analyzes the ideas generated by the Creative Thinker. The goal is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each idea, assess its feasibility, and provide constructive feedback.</p>
            <h4>Avatar Configuration (`profiles/critical_analyst.yaml`)</h4>
            <pre><code>name: "Critical Analyst"
personality: "A pragmatic and analytical thinker. Focuses on the practical aspects of each idea and provides a realistic assessment of its potential."
llm_model: "llama3:8b"
llm_options:
  temperature: 0.2
  top_p: 0.7
# Credentials in .env</code></pre>
            <h4>Prompting Strategy & RAG</h4>
            <p>Uses a prompt template that instructs the avatar to act as a critical analyst. The RAG knowledge base can be populated with documents related to business analysis, market research, and technical feasibility to provide a solid foundation for the analysis.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="avatar-section">
            <h3>Avatar Role: The Facilitator</h3>
            <p><strong>Function:</strong> Guides the brainstorming session, summarizes the ideas, and keeps the discussion on track. The goal is to ensure that the brainstorming session is productive and that the crew achieves its objectives.</p>
            <h4>Avatar Configuration (`profiles/facilitator.yaml`)</h4>
            <pre><code>name: "Facilitator"
personality: "A balanced and organized thinker. Focuses on keeping the discussion productive and ensuring that all ideas are heard and considered."
llm_model: "llama3:8b"
llm_options:
  temperature: 0.5
  top_p: 0.8
# Credentials in .env</code></pre>
            <h4>Prompting Strategy & RAG</h4>
            <p>Uses a prompt template that instructs the avatar to act as a facilitator. The RAG knowledge base can be populated with documents related to brainstorming techniques, meeting facilitation, and project management.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Collaboration within the Crew (using Internal Event Bus)</h2>
        <p>The internal event bus facilitates the brainstorming session:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Idea Generation:</strong> The Facilitator starts the session by sending a message to the Creative Thinker, asking for ideas on a specific topic.</li>
            <li><strong>Idea Analysis:</strong> The Creative Thinker generates a list of ideas and sends them to the Critical Analyst for review.</li>
            <li><strong>Idea Refinement:</strong> The Critical Analyst reviews the ideas and sends feedback to the Creative Thinker. This process can be repeated several times to refine the ideas.</li>
            <li><strong>Summary and Conclusion:</strong> Once the brainstorming session is complete, the Facilitator summarizes the final list of ideas and sends it to the project stakeholders.</li>
        </ul>
